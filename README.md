## Overview

### Description

The organization has full control over the software and can manage their properties listed, user reservations, and the account system. 

### Tech Stack
Hotelverse is a JavaFx program written using Java for the core logic, FXML using SceneBuilder for the front end, and CSS for the front-end styling. Hotelverse’s back-end is powered with a JDBC connection with a MYSQL Google Cloud database through a socket.
